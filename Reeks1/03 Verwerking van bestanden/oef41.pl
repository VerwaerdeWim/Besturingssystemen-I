# You want to write a program that takes a list of filenames on the command line and reads from STDIN 
# if no filenames were given. Youâ€™d like the user to be able to give the file "-" to indicate STDIN 
# or "someprogram |" to indicate the output of another program. You might want your program to modify 
# the files in place or to produce out- put based on its input. (7.14)
